## setup
The front-end of this project is a website built with [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and hosted on github pages. Install jupyter book with
```sh
pip install -U jupyter-book
```
We use the [ghp-import](https://github.com/c-w/ghp-import) package to build and publish the site. Install with
```sh
pip install ghp-import
```
After creating jupyter book configuration (`/book/_config.yml`) and table of contents (`/book/_toc.yml`) files and building locally with
```sh
